Feature: Config command
  As a Solano user
  In order to manage non-commited configuration in Solano
  I want to manage a scoped set of config variables

Background:
  Given the command is "solano config"
  And a git repo is initialized on branch "test/foobar"

Scenario: Display suite config
  Given the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
  And the user has the following config:
    | scope     | name      | value     |
    | account   | foo       | bar       |
    | suite     | quz       | blehher   |
  When I run `solano config`
  Then the output should contain "quz=blehher"
  And the exit status should be 0
  And the output should contain "config:add"

Scenario: Display account config
  Given the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
  And the user has the following config:
    | scope     | name      | value     |
    | account   | foo       | bar       |
    | suite     | quz       | blehher   |
  When I run `solano config org`
  Then the output should contain "foo=bar"
  And the exit status should be 0
  And the output should contain "config:add"

Scenario: Display account config without disambiguating account
  Given the user belongs to two accounts
  And the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
  When I run `solano config org`
  Then the output should contain "You are a member of more than one organization"
  And the exit status should be 1

Scenario: Display account config without disambiguating account
  Given the user belongs to two accounts
  And the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
  When I run `solano config org --org not_my_account`
  Then the output should contain "You aren't a member of organization"
  And the exit status should be 1

Scenario: Display account config for the first account
  Given the user belongs to two accounts
  And the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
  And the user has the following config:
    | scope     | name      | value     |
    | account   | foo       | bar       |
    | suite     | quz       | blehher   |
  When I run `solano config org --org some_account`
  Then the output should contain "foo=bar"
  And the exit status should be 0

Scenario: Display account config for the second account
  Given the user belongs to two accounts
  And the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
  And the user has the following config:
    | scope     | name      | value     |
    | account   | foo       | bar       |
    | suite     | quz       | blehher   |
  When I run `solano config org --org another_account`
  Then the output should not contain "foo=bar"
  And the exit status should be 0

Scenario: Handle no keys
  Given the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
  And the user has no config
  When I run `solano config`
  And the exit status should be 0
  And the output should contain "config:add"

Scenario: Handle API failure
  Given the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
  And there is a problem retrieving config
  When I run `solano config`
  Then the exit status should not be 0
  And the output should contain "API Error"

Scenario: Fail if the user isn't logged in
  When I run `solano config`
  Then it should fail with a login hint

Scenario: Add suite config
  Given the user is logged in with a configured suite on branch "test/foobar"
